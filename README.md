# Data Analyst Internship Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

## Objective:

## Tools Used:
- **Tableau** or **Power BI** for creating visualizations.
- Data source: "Superstore.csv" (or another sales dataset of choice).

## Steps to Complete the Task:

1. **Dataset Exploration**

2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**

3. **Visualization Creation**

4. **Dashboard/Report Creation**

5. **Data Storytelling**

## Key Insights:

- Avoid **clutter** in visualizations by keeping the design simple and clear.
- Ensure that each chart has **context** and highlights key takeaways.
